# PEPCB – Power Electronics PCB Automation Toolkit

**PEPCB** is an open-source toolkit designed to automate PCB design workflows in **power electronics**. It provides a modular system for layout solving, parasitic evaluation, and integration with existing EDA tools like KiCad, Altium, and Eagle. PEPCB aims to simplify and accelerate the design process of high-power, high-performance circuit boards.

## 🔧 Features

- **Layout Solver**  
  Automated component placement and routing engine for power electronics, written in C/C++ and callable from Python.

- **Parasitic Evaluation**  
  Tools to estimate and analyze parasitic effects (e.g., trace impedance, coupling) during design stages.

- **Visualization UI**  
  Lightweight C/C++ UI for inspecting and debugging polygon-based layout data.

- **EDA Connectors**  
  Interfaces to read and write data from/to popular PCB design tools (such as KiCad, Altium, Eagle).

- **Gerber Conversion**  
  Utilities for generating Gerber files from intermediate formats.

- **Plugin Support**  
  Extend functionality directly within EDA tools via custom plugins.
